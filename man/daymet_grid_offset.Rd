\title{Returns an offset dataset with data running from offset DOY in year - 1 to
offset DOY in the current year. Two years of data (730 data layers) are
required for this function to work. The output serves as input for further
data processing and / or ecosystem modelling efforts.}
\usage{
daymet_grid_offset(data, offset = 264)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{rasterStack or rasterBrick of 730 layers (2 consecutive years)}

\item{offset}{offset of the time series in DOY (default = 264, sept 21)}
